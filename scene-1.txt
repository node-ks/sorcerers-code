Black Screen

PRE-LAP: We hear a loud, booming, indiscernibly low-pitched sound that repeats with the tempo of a dripping faucet.

							Harry(V.O.)
			I always imagined what it would be like. I just never thought of the consequences.

FADE IN:

INT. Living Room - Dusk

In a smallish room that is mostly unfurnished, except for one decrepit leather chair. We see the back of Harry's head while he is sitting on the floor, facing a dirty wall.  The sounds we heard before become clear and we see it is Harry BOUNCING a ball off the wall. His disheveled appearance matches the rest of the room.

CLOSE ON HARRY'S FACE that shows a grim expression and eyes that seem to stare at something beyond the wall.

							HARRY(V.O.)
				For what it's worth: I saw it coming. I saw it coming . . . and still . . .
				

EXT. Woods - sweltering summer - Mid-afternoon

We see Harry, who is visibly hot, and sweating profusely, SHOVELING dirt from a mound into a hole that looks like could fit a person. His breathing indicates that he has be doing this for a while.
											
							Harry(V.O.)
				Even though I saw it coming, I still have no idea how I let it happen.
